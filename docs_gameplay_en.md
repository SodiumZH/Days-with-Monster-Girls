## Mob details

#### Zombie Girl (HMaG)

##### Befriending

Give 1-3 diamonds. After giving each one, there's 10s cooldown time. Green-star particles will appear when you successfully gave an item, and heart particles will appear when you befriended them. 

*This befriending process is temporary because related items are not added. On update the condition will change and this instruction will also be updated.*

##### Interaction

Right click to switch the AI state among Wait, Follow and Wander.

Shift + Right click to open inventory. You can customize their armor and hand items. 

There are 2 extra slots (gem icon), and you can put diamond inside, but any related features are not added so far.

##### Features

Currently converting to Drowned is not added because Drowned Girl is not finished. If the Zombie Girl is converted from a Husk Girl, it can be converted back to Husk Girl by using a sponge to it.



#### Skeleton Girl (HMaG)

##### Befriending

Same to Zombie Girl.

##### Interaction

Same to Zombie Girl. 

You can customize their armors, hand items (bow and shield icons) and secondary weapon (sword icon, described below). There is an arrow slot (arrow icon), and you must put arrows inside to enable shooting, and they will consume arrows to shoot.

##### Features

The secondary weapon slot (sword icon) enables the skeleton to automatically swap the weapons on close combat and shooting. When the enemy is too close or the arrows run out, it will try swapping to the sword/tool in the secondary weapon slot for close combat. If the enemy is far away and it has arrows, it will also try swapping to the bow.
