## Mob details

#### Zombie Girl (HMaG)

##### Befriending

Give 1-3 diamonds. After giving each one, there's 10s cooldown time. Green-star particles will appear when you successfully gave an item, and heart particles will appear when you befriended them. 

*This befriending process is temporary because related items are not added. On update the condition will change and this instruction will also be updated.*

##### Interaction

Right click to switch the AI state among Wait, Follow and Wander. 

Shift + Right click to open inventory. You can customize their armor and hand items. 

(The 2 interaction ways are available for all mobs unless other noted.)

There are 2 extra slots (gem icon), and you can put diamond inside, but any related features are not added so far.

##### Features

Currently converting to Drowned is not added because Drowned Girl is not finished. If the Zombie Girl is converted from a Husk Girl, it can be converted back to Husk Girl by using a sponge to it.



#### Skeleton Girl (HMaG)

##### Befriending

Same to Zombie Girl.

##### Interaction

Same to Zombie Girl. 

You can customize their armors, hand items (bow and shield icons) and secondary weapon (sword icon, described below). There is an arrow slot (arrow icon), and you must put arrows inside to enable shooting, and they will consume arrows to shoot.

##### Features

The secondary weapon slot (sword icon) enables the skeleton to automatically swap the weapons on close combat and shooting. When the enemy is too close or the arrows run out, it will try swapping to the sword/tool in the secondary weapon slot for close combat. If the enemy is far away and it has arrows, it will also try swapping to the bow.



#### Husk Girl (HMaG)

##### Befriending

Same to Zombie Girl.

##### Interaction

Same to Zombie Girl. 

##### Features

It can convert to Zombie Girl in water. The converted Zombie Girl can be recovered to Husk by using a sponge to it.



#### Creeper Girl (HMaG)

##### Befriending

Give it 2-3 TNTs. There's 5s cooldown each TNT. (Do this without making it explode!)

If the TNT condition is satisfied, the Creeper Girl will stop moving, start swelling for 4s  and generate tons of green-star and smoke particles. After this, it will make a **HUGE EXPLOSION** (Range 12, block-breaking). When it's swelling, you must stay no further than 8 blocks away from it (or it will be interrupted and you have to start from giving it TNTs). You must survive the explosion, and after that it's done.

**Interaction**

Right click with Flint & Steel to ignite it.

You can customize its armor and hand items. There's an extra ammo slot (explosive icon), and only with ammo it can explode (no damage to itself).

The ammo slot receives either Gunpowder or TNT and consumes one for each explosion. With Gunpowder its explosion has range 3 and doesn't break blocks. With TNT its explosion has range 4 and breaks blocks (if mobGriefing is true). If it's charged, the explosion range will be 6 for Gunpowder and 8 for TNT, consuming 2 ammo items.

You can manually charge it by using a Particle of Lightning to it. If it's charged, you can right click with bare hand to uncharge it, dropping a Particle of Lightning.

##### Features

On combat, it will try exploding on enemies if having ammo, and try close combat if having a weapon on the main hand.
